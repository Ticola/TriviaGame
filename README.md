### **Playing The Game**

The game is a trivia form with a multiple choice layout. The player will have a limited amount of time *(30 seconds)* to finish the quiz. The game ends when the player has answered all 7 questions. Upon completion, the page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly and also allow the player to make another attempt and play again.

This Game was created with:
```
git status
git add
git commit

```
